A repository dedicated to resources about "platform as a product". Feel free to contribute. 

There are many "awesome-platform" resources, but this repository is a bit more niche on the product side. 

Including content related to:
1. Calculating ROI and getting platform capabilities funded
2. Convincing stakeholders, storytelling, etc. 
3. General platform design and UX aspects.

This doesn't necessarily include highly technical aspects of platform like: 
* Platform architectures
* Things about Kubernetes

As the internet already has plenty of that so far !
